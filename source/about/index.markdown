![Accurate Profile Picture](http://www.littlehart.net/workz-for-me-u-must-b-dum.jpg)

Chris Hartjes has been building web applications of all shapes and sizes since
1998, ranging from catalogs for CD compilations for professional DJ's to
large-scale dating web sites. 

A huge consumer of open-source software, Chris tries to give back to the community
via his blog, by speaking at conferences, and by co-organizing the [GTA PHP User Group](http://meetup.gtaphp.org).
He is also a big believer in the power of testing and automation as secret
weapons for organizations to deliver high quality applications quickly.

He lives in Milton, Ontario, Canada with his long-suffering wife, two daughters, a furry pig
masquerading as a cat, and the reincarnation of the Roman god of the underworld in feline form.
